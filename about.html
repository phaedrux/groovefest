  <h1>What is Groovefest</h1>
  <p>Groovefest was created by University of Oklahoma students, artists, musicians and activists in 1986, with the intention of raising human rights awareness in our community and all over the world. Through the years, the leadership of Groovefest has changed many times  - but the spirit of broadening our collective awareness of Human Rights continues. 
</p>
  <h2><a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/" target="_blank">Declaration of Human Rights Summary</a></h2>
  <p>Article 1 set the basic philosophy of the Declaration: "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act toward one another in a spirit of brotherhood." Article 2 set out the principle of non-discrimination in the enjoyment of human rights. Articles 3 through 21 laid down political and civil rights, including the right to life, liberty and property; freedom from torture or degrading treatment or punishment; freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention or exile; the right to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal; freedom of thought and religion; freedom of expression; the right to peaceful assembly and association.  </p>
  <p>Articles 22 through 27 established economic, social and cultural rights. These included the right to work; the right to social security; the right to equal pay for equal work; the right to rest and leisure; the right to an adequate standard of living; the right to education; and the right to participate in the cultural life of the community. </p>

  <h2>What does the theme mean?</h2>
  <p>Human Rights work didn’t end with the advancements made in the Women’s Rights movement of the 1920’s, or the Civil Rights movement of the 1960’s - and it doesn’t just take place in third world countries. The fight to secure Human Rights for all individuals will continue as long as our society grows and evolves - So we must continue to educate ourselves on the complexity of the human experience and come together to fight these continuing injustices. Human Rights action takes place right here in Oklahoma, and it affects every Oklahoman. Norman Groovefest hopes to highlight the great work of many local organizations, artists, and businesses that promote Human Rights in all forms.</p>
